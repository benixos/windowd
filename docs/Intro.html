                <h3>A Network Transparent Data and State Protocol</h3>
			<p>

                The Internet and its increasingly fine grained integration into daily life has lead to smarter more connected devices however the devices lack a central and cross platform solution for data synchronization which leads to pools of isolated data. As a solution to this issue we present Silver Iodine (AgI). Named after the chemical used in weather control experiments to "seed" cloud formation, this project seeks to do the same across the digital landscape by incorporation a unified lightweight and portable protocol to abstract not only file location but related meta data to create a coherent namespace across networks and devices.<br>
                <br><br>
                Inspiration for  this project comes largely from the 9p, the protocol developed by Bell Labs for the Plan 9 operating system. Plan 9 was an attempt at a better Unix than Unix that forced all system resources to present themselves as files with user level applications communicating with one another via a unified protocol. Use of 9p allowed for the development of distributed computing cluster with little effort, one could simple mount the resources of another computing device and write data, even if the device in question was another computer's CPU and the file written was a program to be run.<br>
